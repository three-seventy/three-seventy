I would like to thank all of the following without whom this would not be possible.


# Inspiration and Motivation

Firstly, I would like to thank **Moshix** whose videos have taught me so much. Coming from outside the mainframe community as my career was mostly in the Open Systems/Linux sphere, I have found myself lacking knowledge in such basic areas when I started with emulating mainframes as I hadn't touched a mainframe in over two decades. Over the years I have gained so much from Moshix and been inspired to dig deeper. Moshix introduced me to [**TK4-**](https://wotho.pebble-beach.ch/tk4-/) and other operating systems and caused me to get hooked on emulating them.

Secondly, my thanks go to **Jay Moseley** who showed me how easy it was to setup my own custom installations using his installation instructions which was the basis on this distribution. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank **Matthew Wilson** (from the YouTube channel *Mainframes & More with Matthew*) which inspired me to take the plunge and develop this distribution of MVS.
