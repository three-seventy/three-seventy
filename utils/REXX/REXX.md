Certain build utilities require the use of either Perl or REXX.

# The REXX Language

The Regina REXX distribution can be downloaded from their [SourceForge repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regina-rexx/files/regina-rexx) 

### Windows

The latest Regina REXX installer is included in the utils/REXX directory. Alternatively 

### Linux 

Many distributions contain their own package for REXX, often the Regina REXX distribution. 

We recommend installing the distributions REXX interpreter via your package manager, for example, on Debian you may install Regina REXX using:

```shell
sudo apt install regina-rexx
```

Alternatively, you can download a copy of Regina REXX from their [SourceForge repository](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regina-rexx/files/regina-rexx)


# The Perl Language

Available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It has also been ported to the various BSD distributions.

### Linux

Many Linux distributions have Perl preinstalled. To check if Linux is pre-installed run

```shell
perl -v 
```
At the shell prompt.

If it is not installed use your package manager to install perl, or you can download Perl

### Windows and Mac

Download Perl from the Perl website, see *Downloading Perl* below.

### FreeBSD and other BSDs

Perl is available for your BSD's ports collection in both source and binary formats. Use either your package manager or build Perl from soruce using your ports tree.
